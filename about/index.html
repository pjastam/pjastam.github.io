	<h1>About</h1>
	<p>I gained my data scientist skills by training. I improved and extended these skills at various workplaces, either as an employee or entrepreneur. And I did some good old fashioned homework to obtain some data engineering skills. Most helpul there were technical books and forums, online computer courses and the open source community. Follow my tech timeline below if like to know more about my tech profile...</a></p>

				<h2>BASIC</h2>
				<p>My first computer was a Commodore 64, which I bought from the money that I earned with a holidays job. Loved to play the computer games, but was immediately hooked when I found out how to create my own programs by coding in BASIC and machine language.</p>

				<h2>Turbo Pascal</h2>
				<p>A few years later, during my econometrics bachelor's, I bought a *86 Windows machine and started coding in Turbo Pascal to start with. I encountered a whole bunch of other computer languages down the line, which were useful one way or the other. Never a dull moment!</p>

				<h2>FORTRAN</h2>
				<p>As a student assistant at the department of Mathematical Economics I worked on a European project. The goal was to choose determine which poverty index measures financial poverty among populations best. Back to basics: we coded in FORTRAN.</p>

				<h2>Matlab</h2>
				<p>I obtained a masters degree in econometrics on the subject of fractionally integrated time series modeling. Never used it in my career later on, but what the hack. Coding in Matlab was fun.</p>

				<h2>Gauss</h2>
				<p>Started working at an academic research company and coded my projects in Gauss. Creating reports on one of the first Macintosh machines was a (non lifetime changing) new experience for me. And yes, also those things sometimes needed a hard reset, nothinng new there.</p>

				<h2>SAS</h2>
				<p>I thought about doing a PhD, but chose to leave the college atmosphere. Surely, to create publications in scientific magazines in order to show how good you are to your colleagues couldn't be the meaning of life. If I cannot explain my family what I am doing, how could it be worth doing it?</p>

				<h2>SAS, again</h2>
				<p>So, I started to work at an insurance company. Huhh??? Yes, a health insurance company. Why? Big data. Yes!!! A few years later, in order to satisfy my scientific curiosity, I started writing a PhD thesis on the subject of risk equalization among health insurers. Coding in SAS.</p>

				<h2>HTML</h2>
				<p>In the nineties I started creating my first homepage. I included RSS feeds from external sources to economize on search costs for scientific news items.</p>

				<p> Along the line I started a website development company. And I coded my own scaper and aggregator in PHP and MySQL, just because many RSS feeds were lacking in those days.</p>
