We estimated the odds of football matches in the last two weeks of the 2018/2019 Dutch Eredivisie football competiton. All results and my explanations can be found [here](http://htmlpreview.github.com/?https://github.com/pjastam/r-bayesian-football-odds/blob/master/NL_eredivisie_2014_2019.nb.html). If you are interested in the code, you can find that on [GitHub](https://github.com/pjastam/r-bayesian-football-odds).
